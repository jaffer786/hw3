there is actually a third important network-layer function, namely, connection setup. Some network-layer architectures—for example, ATM, frame relay, and MPLS (which we will study in Section 5.8)––require the routers along the chosen path from source to destination to handshake with each other in order to set up state before network-layer data packets within a given source-to-destination connection can begin to flow. In the network layer, this process is referred to as connection setup.

-The network service model defines the characteristics of end-to-end transport of packets between sending and receiving end systems.
specific services that could be provided by the network layer include: 
• Guaranteed delivery. This service guarantees that the packet will eventually arrive at its destination. 
• Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay. This service not only guarantees delivery of the packet, but delivery within a specified host-to-host delay bound (for example, within 100 msec). 

Furthermore, the following services could be provided to a flow of packets between a given source and destination: 

• In-order packet delivery. This service guarantees that packets arrive at the destination in the order that they were sent. 
• Guaranteed minimal bandwidth. This network-layer service emulates the behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate (for example, 1 Mbps) between sending and receiving hosts. As long as the sending host transmits bits (as part of packets) at a rate below the specified bit rate, then no packet is lost and each packet arrives within a prespecified host-to-host delay (for example, within 40 msec). 
• Guaranteed maximum jitter. This service guarantees that the amount of time between the transmission of two successive packets at the sender is equal to the amount of time between their receipt at the destination (or that this spacing changes by no more than some specified value). 
• Security services. Using a secret session key known only by a source and destination host, the network layer in the source host could encrypt the payloads of all datagrams being sent to the destination host. The network layer in the destination host would then be responsible for decrypting the payloads. With such a service, confidentiality would be provided to all transport-layer segments (TCP and UDP) between the source and destination hosts. In addition to confidentiality, the network layer could provide data integrity and source authentication services.

Furthermore, the following services could be provided to a flow of packets between a given source and destination: 

• In-order packet delivery. This service guarantees that packets arrive at the destination in the order that they were sent. 
• Guaranteed minimal bandwidth. This network-layer service emulates the behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate (for example, 1 Mbps) between sending and receiving hosts. As long as the sending host transmits bits (as part of packets) at a rate below the specified bit rate, then no packet is lost and each packet arrives within a prespecified host-to-host delay (for example, within 40 msec). 
• Guaranteed maximum jitter. This service guarantees that the amount of time between the transmission of two successive packets at the sender is equal to the amount of time between their receipt at the destination (or that this spacing changes by no more than some specified value). 
• Security services. Using a secret session key known only by a source and destination host, the network layer in the source host could encrypt the payloads of all datagrams being sent to the destination host. The network layer in the destination host would then be responsible for decrypting the payloads. With such a service, confidentiality would be provided to all transport-layer segments (TCP and UDP) between the source and destination hosts.

there is actually a third important network-layer function, namely, connection setup. Some network-layer architectures—for example, ATM, frame relay, and MPLS (which we will study in Section 5.8)––require the routers along the chosen path from source to destination to handshake with each other in order to set up state before network-layer data packets within a given source-to-destination connection can begin to flow. In the network layer, this process is referred to as connection setup.

-The network service model defines the characteristics of end-to-end transport of packets between sending and receiving end systems.
specific services that could be provided by the network layer include: 
• Guaranteed delivery. This service guarantees that the packet will eventually arrive at its destination. 
• Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay. This service not only guarantees delivery of the packet, but delivery within a specified host-to-host delay bound (for example, within 100 msec). 

Furthermore, the following services could be provided to a flow of packets between a given source and destination: 

• In-order packet delivery. This service guarantees that packets arrive at the destination in the order that they were sent. 
• Guaranteed minimal bandwidth. This network-layer service emulates the behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate (for example, 1 Mbps) between sending and receiving hosts. As long as the sending host transmits bits (as part of packets) at a rate below the specified bit rate, then no packet is lost and each packet arrives within a prespecified host-to-host delay (for example, within 40 msec). 
• Guaranteed maximum jitter. This service guarantees that the amount of time between the transmission of two successive packets at the sender is equal to the amount of time between their receipt at the destination (or that this spacing changes by no more than some specified value). 
• Security services. Using a secret session key known only by a source and destination host, the network layer in the source host could encrypt the payloads of all datagrams being sent to the destination host.

-The network service model defines the characteristics of end-to-end transport of packets between sending and receiving end systems.
specific services that could be provided by the network layer include: 
• Guaranteed delivery. This service guarantees that the packet will eventually arrive at its destination. 
• Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay. This service not only guarantees delivery of the packet, but delivery within a specified host-to-host delay bound (for example, within 100 msec). 

Furthermore, the following services could be provided to a flow of packets between a given source and destination: 

• In-order packet delivery. This service guarantees that packets arrive at the destination in the order that they were sent. 
• Guaranteed minimal bandwidth. This network-layer service emulates the behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate (for example, 1 Mbps) between sending and receiving hosts. As long as the sending host transmits bits (as part of packets) at a rate below the specified bit rate, then no packet is lost and each packet arrives within a prespecified host-to-host delay (for example, within 40 msec). 
• Guaranteed maximum jitter. This service guarantees that the amount of time between the transmission of two successive packets at the sender is equal to the amount of time between their receipt at the destination (or that this spacing changes by no more than some specified value). 
• Security services. Using a secret session key known only by a source and destination host, the network layer in the source host could encrypt the payloads of all datagrams being sent to the destination host. The network layer in the destination host would then be responsible for decrypting the payloads. With such a service, confidentiality would be provided to all transport-layer segments (TCP and UDP) between the source and destination hosts.

• In-order packet delivery. This service guarantees that packets arrive at the destination in the order that they were sent. 
• Guaranteed minimal bandwidth. This network-layer service emulates the behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate (for example, 1 Mbps) between sending and receiving hosts. As long as the sending host transmits bits (as part of packets) at a rate below the specified bit rate, then no packet is lost and each packet arrives within a prespecified host-to-host delay (for example, within 40 msec). 
• Guaranteed maximum jitter. This service guarantees that the amount of time between the transmission of two successive packets at the sender is equal to the amount of time between their receipt at the destination (or that this spacing changes by no more than some specified value). 
• Security services. Using a secret session key known only by a source and destination host, the network layer in the source host could encrypt the payloads of all datagrams being sent to the destination host. The network layer in the destination host would then be responsible for decrypting the payloads. With such a service, confidentiality would be provided to all transport-layer segments (TCP and UDP) between the source and destination hosts.

• Guaranteed maximum jitter. This service guarantees that the amount of time between the transmission of two successive packets at the sender is equal to the amount of time between their receipt at the destination (or that this spacing changes by no more than some specified value). 
• Security services. Using a secret session key known only by a source and destination host, the network layer in the source host could encrypt the payloads of all datagrams being sent to the destination host. The network layer in the destination host would then be responsible for decrypting the payloads. With such a service, confidentiality would be provided to all transport-layer segments (TCP and UDP) between the source and destination hosts. In addition to confidentiality, the network layer could provide data integrity and source authentication services.
which are used to configure its forwarding table.

there is actually a third important network-layer function, namely, connection setup. Some network-layer architectures—for example, ATM, frame relay, and MPLS (which we will study in Section 5.8)––require the routers along the chosen path from source to destination to handshake with each other in order to set up state before network-layer data packets within a given source-to-destination connection can begin to flow. In the network layer, this process is referred to as connection setup.

-The network service model defines the characteristics of end-to-end transport of packets between sending and receiving end systems.
specific services that could be provided by the network layer include: 
• Guaranteed delivery. This service guarantees that the packet will eventually arrive at its destination. 
• Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay. This service not only guarantees delivery of the packet, but delivery within a specified host-to-host delay bound (for example, within 100 msec). 

Furthermore, the following services could be provided to a flow of packets between a given source and destination: 

• In-order packet delivery. This service guarantees that packets arrive at the destination in the order that they were sent. 
• Guaranteed minimal bandwidth. This network-layer service emulates the behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate (for example, 1 Mbps) between sending and receiving hosts.
